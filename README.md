# Our Mission

## The Fediverse Space Mission

>From YouTube channels to Facebook lives, as well as Amazon-Twitch, Instagram, Snapchat and Tiktok videos, the web giants’ tools are made with the same political ideology in mind : surveillance capitalism. Their goal is simple : get your attention in to study your behaviors, file them and improve their targeted advertising. Their method is effective : offering as much software comfort and immediate gratification as possible, in order to make you abandon your control over your tool, so that they can invade and fill your available human brain time.

>As such, these tools are perfectly adapted for people who have no issue with a society based on over-consumption, and who trust multi-billionaire companies (and therefore the « market ») to decide what will or will not be shown on our screens (like with Tiktok, which moderates the videos and accounts of users they deem too ugly, fat or poor).

>PeerTube (a free software), developed by Framasoft, is the free and decentralized alternative to video platforms, providing you over 400,000 videos published by 60,000 users and viewed over 15 million times

✨​ The Fediverse Space (a portmanteau of "federation" and "universe") is an ensemble of decentralized (i.e. interconnected) servers that are used for Media Publishing, but while decentralized, these servers can communicate with each other and guarantee media redundancy!
