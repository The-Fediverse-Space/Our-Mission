# Our Mission
The Fediverse Space Mission

✨​ The Fediverse Space (a portmanteau of "federation" and "universe") is an ensemble of decentralized (i.e. interconnected) servers that are used for Media Publishing, but while decentralized, these servers can communicate with each other and guarantee media redundancy!
