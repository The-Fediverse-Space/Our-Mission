# Our Mission

## The Fediverse Space Mission

><div align="justify", style="font-size : 8px;">From YouTube channels to Facebook lives, as well as Amazon-Twitch, Instagram, Snapchat and Tiktok videos, the web giants’ tools are made with the same political ideology in mind : surveillance capitalism. Their goal is simple : get your attention in to study your behaviors, file them and improve their targeted advertising. Their method is effective : offering as much software comfort and immediate gratification as possible, in order to make you abandon your control over your tool, so that they can invade and fill your available human brain time.</div>

><div align="justify", style="font-size : 10px;">As such, these tools are perfectly adapted for people who have no issue with a society based on over-consumption, and who trust multi-billionaire companies (and therefore the « market ») to decide what will or will not be shown on our screens (like with Tiktok, which moderates the videos and accounts of users they deem too ugly, fat or poor).</div>

><div align="justify", style="font-size : 8px;">PeerTube (a free software), developed by Framasoft, is the free and decentralized alternative to video platforms, providing you over 400,000 videos published by 60,000 users and viewed over 15 million times</div>

✨​ The Fediverse Space (a portmanteau of "federation" and "universe") is an ensemble of decentralized (i.e. interconnected) servers that are used for Media Publishing, but while decentralized, these servers can communicate with each other and guarantee media redundancy! 

# A Federated Answer to Social Media Centralization

<div align="justify">I’ll like to introduce the Fediverse Space, a social media network founded by The American Free Speech Society (to be formed as Not For Profit Organization under the IRS 501c3) in the spirit of a decentralized and free Internet. A decentralized web has plenty of challenges and is not necessarily for the faint-hearted, but there are good reasons to persevere. The American Free Speech Society has taken the task to resolve the challenges of deployment of a decentralized media network.</div>
<br>
<div align="justify">On July 15, 2020, one of the biggest scams in Twitter’s history happened. Through intelligent social engineering, a group of people managed to gain access to Twitter’s administrative tools, allowing them to post tweets directly from several high-profile accounts.
<br>
<div align="justify">More than 130 influential Twitter accounts were hacked. In a matter of minutes, the profiles of Apple, Bill Gates, Elon Musk, and others asked individuals to send Bitcoin to a cryptocurrency wallet, with the promise that the money sent would be doubled and returned as a charitable gesture. Within minutes of the initial tweets, more than 300 transactions had already taken place — to a value of over US$180,000 — before Twitter took the scam messages down.</div>
<br>
<div align="justify">With a centralized structure in place, only a single person with administrative rights needed to be tricked into giving out access to these high-profile accounts. In similar circumstances, someone with a more sinister motive might aim at a stock market crash, fabricated political tension, or even global unrest.</div>

# The Pros and Cons of Centralization

<div align="justify">Centralization is a double-edged sword. Its core idea is based on the storage, ownership, and protection of your data by a social media platform. While this sounds awful, there are benefits. The first and strongest advantage of centralized platforms is their ease of use. For example, when you forget your password or your account gets hacked, platforms with a centralized structure can recover them with ease, since they store all of your data on their servers.</div>
<br>
<div align="justify">But this sense of protection comes at a price. Your data — like tweets, retweets, likes, and shares — are stored and owned by a corporation. These companies have yearly financial KPIs, and your data is a great way for them to generate money, primarily when used for targeted advertisements. Another downside to such platforms is that they’re not open source, meaning there’s no transparency between the users and the platform they’re on. As a user, you have no idea what’s happening under the hood or how your data is being handled.>/div> 

<p align="center"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/WF1xW7b/dectralized-v1-resize.png?raw=true" alt="Sublime's custom image"/></p>

<div align="justify">So what if there was a platform with a decentralized structure, where you owned what you posted and you could see what your data was being used for? For a long time, people have tried to create such platforms — App.net, Peach, Diaspora and Ello are a few of the better-known examples. But the latest pioneer in decentralized social media comes with all of the benefits listed above.</div>

# What is Mastodon

<div align="justify">Mastodon was released in 2016. In the eyes of many, this network is the first step in social media decentralization. While similar to Twitter in both appearance and features, Mastodon focuses on the safety and privacy of its user base by being decentralized and federated. All of its data are distributed across a vast number of independent servers, known as “instances”. Each instance has its own terms of service, code of conduct, and moderation policies while working seamlessly together with other servers as a federating network.</div>

# What is PeerTube

<div align="justify">PeerTube is a free and open-source, decentralized, federated video platform powered by ActivityPub and WebTorrent, that uses peer-to-peer technology to reduce load on individual servers when viewing videos. Started in 2015 by a programmer known as Chocobozz, development of PeerTube is now supported by the French non-profit Framasoft.</div> 
</br>

>PeerTube is a federated (ActivityPub) video streaming platform using P2P (BitTorrent) directly in the web browser with WebTorrent and Angular.

# What is Mobilizon

Mobilizon is a tool that helps you find, create and organise events. You can also create a page for your group where the members will be able to organise together.

 _An ethical alternative_


Ethical alternative to Facebook events, groups and pages, Mobilizon is a tool designed to serve you. _No likes_, _no follows_, _no infinite wall to scroll: Mobilizon leaves you in control of your attention._
 
 ## A federated code
 
Mobilizon is not a giant platform, but a multitude of interconnected Mobilizon websites. This federated architecture helps avoid monopolies and offers a diversity of hosting terms of service.

# The American Free Speech Society Corp
 
Free speech is an important human right, and one that aligns closely with TAFS’s greater mission: to make the internet safer for everyone. We believe that free speech and free press play a critical role in exposing injustice and inequality, and we also know that free speech is under attack in many ways and for many groups of people.

## Mission Statement
 
The mission of The American Free Speech Society is two-fold, to allow media creators to have another delivery method of their content online and build an archive of media for anyone to view in the future. TAFS will deploy and host online media instances, as an alternative platform, that aid in the distribution of media (video and audio) in a decentralized federated network. The network technology will be available to Media content creators and the option of their content to be federated across the fediverse network globally.   
 
A good example of the only current model opearating is is the [http://wayback.archive.org/](http://wayback.archive.org/)  but such service is limited in scope and mission to address the modern issues of free speech online and censorship of Big Tech and their use of of Surveillance Capitalism .  
 
The Fedivese currently runs several Instance with district domains;
